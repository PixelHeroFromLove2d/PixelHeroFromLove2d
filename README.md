- ðŸ˜º Hi, Iâ€™m PixelHeroFromLove2d
- ðŸ“Œ Iâ€™m interested in Game coding, Music making, and Sprite work.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning game coding using the Love2d framework.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Lua projects on Love2d

As my username suggests, I have an account on the Love2d forums. PixelHero wasn't available, so I chose this. I'll probably edit this later.
Here's my symbol:
